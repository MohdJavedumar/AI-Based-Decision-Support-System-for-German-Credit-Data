# AI-Based Decision Support System

The purpose of the project is to build and implement an AI based Decision support system for banking sector. The term decision support system (DSS) refers to an application that can be used in a wide range of businesses to assist management in making informed decisions. 

This project will explore the banking sector for the following reasons: In the banking sector, the importance of a decision support system based on artificial intelligence is evident, since banks and other financial institutions are integral to the modern economy and deal with large volumes of data. 

The project will be managed using Agile project management methods in order to ensure a high - quality outcome. Both the study and implementation of the project will be presented in the project. We are going to use elbow method to find the number of clusters and at last we visualize the data.

We have extracted some association rule from kmeans clustering model output. First Cluster has association with  Higher credit amount | middle-aged | long duration customers category. Second Cluster has assocoation with Lower credit amount | young-aged |short duration customers category. Third Cluster has association with  Lower credit amount | old-aged | short duration customers category.

On the contrary DBSCAN has not performed well. Its hard to identify different clusters in DBSCAN plot. The centroid of clusters are not adequetly placed in model training. Clustered are more hetrogenuous than overall distribution. We can not easily differentiate clusters from each others. 
Finally we have chosen Kmeans Clustering algorithm for model building to segment the credit customers. As we have trained model on only 1000 records our model could be under/over fit to testing data, so we have to collect more data and build model on that data for minimizing the uncertianity in our prediction. The more data will certainly help us to build more robust model for future use. Also there are several clustering algorithm available like hierarichal clustering algorithm and more complex and effcient algorithm. 

To ensure smooth dataflow in our AI-Decision Support System we should utilize cloud database server for better accessbilty and connection support. We can automate the whole Decision Support System by utilising cloud services. Customar segmentation decision emotionally supportive networks (DSS) could empower dynamic through information displaying and mathematical estimations and need coordinating subjective, quantitative and prescient examination to give close to-human intelligence in navigation.
